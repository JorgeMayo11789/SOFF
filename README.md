# SOFF
Senior engineering design team project for the SOFF (Slices Only Fresh Fruit) device

## Project Summary:
Many elderly and disabled people have trouble slicing their fruit into reasonable sizes. This can lead them into not eating the fruit on time and can result in wasted food. The purpose of this project is to create a device that can detect the ripeness of the fruit, alert the user of the fruitâ€™s state, then slice the fruit for them.
