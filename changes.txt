List of Changes:
Added a new class and xml file called Fruit_List
Added some code to Main_Activity to write to text file(new method: save_to_textfile)
Added a new button to Settings_Activity that opens up Fruit_List
Image fix changed some code in BluetoothConnectionService

Notes:

-by default whenever "CUT" button is pressed. it stores the the name "Apple" in the textfile no matter what fruit name is sent, this is intentional
-Couldn't test this out yet due to usb cable problems but these additions should work properly
