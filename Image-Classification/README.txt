# Separate Test and Training Images
Create two folders called training_images and testing_images. Ensure they are created inside of the working repository.
In the training_images folder, create directories for each classification you'd like and make sure to download as many images for each type.
E.g. \Image-Classification\training_images\apples and \Image-Classification\training_images\mangos
Next, save some test images in the test_images directory to test the classification.
